          <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
          <p>In the United States, <b>11.4 million Americans</b> fit the criteria of living within a food desert<sup>[2]</sup>. We decided to make a difference and create an online geographical network of available food from individuals and businesses across Richmond Virginia to address food insecurity and food waste in one swift go.

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Food insecurity is defined by the USDA as “the limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods, or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways”<sup>[1]</sup>. Food deserts are further by the USDA for low-income, low-access areas where reasonable access to a grocery store within a 1 mile radius in urban areas or a 10 mile radius in rural areas is not possible<sup>[3]</sup>.</p>
                <p>Richmond Virginia is a highly populated and lively city filled with restaurants, bars, and convenience stores every few blocks. However, this flashy and bustling city is a well recognized food insecure area, even referred to as a food desert within most of its boundary.</p>
                <p>The heart of Richmond contains Virginia Commonwealth University’s Monroe Park Campus and boasts a current 2022 population of 1,128,000 residents. Between college aged students and family homes within the city, many do not have access to nutritious and affordable food for their households. The Carver Neighborhood and Church Hill are most notably known for their lack of access to affordable and nutritious food. Church Hill was most recently removed from the category of “food desert” after the implementation of “The Market at 25th,” a grocery store aimed at tackling the food insecurity in the region. The intention was great, but the application fell short. High prices immediately deterred the low-income, low-access portion of the town and attracted those who could afford to pay higher prices for the trendy and new grocery store. Additional constraints on discounts for low-income,low-access residents such as the need for EBT/SNAP cards and lack of public transportation to the area due to the new GRTC bus line counteracted the businesses good intentions of providing some means to address food insecurity in the neighborhood.</p>
                <p>Many residents of the city rely on the good graces of food banks, food pantries, and generous businesses and individuals to help them make ends meet when their access to affordable and nutritious food is strained.</p>
                <p>For our project, we aimed to provide a solution to this problem on the smaller scale of Richmond, VA that can then be scaled up. <b>Our team decided to create an open source website for small businesses and individuals to advertise instances of pop-up, or “temporary” free food events.</b> This includes anything from good civilians hosting food drives to businesses with leftover food at the end of business hours promoting a location to pick up those leftovers that would otherwise be placed in dumpsters. <b>Our solution helps divert food waste from dumpsters and put food into the hands of civilians who need it.</b></p>
                <p>Every human deserves access to affordable and consistent sustenance, ideally being nutritious as well. <b>Our web interface allows for individuals and businesses to fill out a quick and simple google form that asks for general information and location data which is then translated onto a map for hungry viewers to see.</b></p>
                <p>From this map, viewers can observe information such as the <u>address</u>, <u>time range that food is available</u>, and a <u>direct link to Google Maps to access the location via foot, public transportation, or personal vehicle</u>. This ensures that regardless of the method of transportation the individual has access to, they can find 1) where food will be available and 2) how to access it in a manner that suits their lifestyle parameters.
